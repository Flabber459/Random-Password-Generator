# Random Password Generator

## Description

I undertook this project in order to help users create a randomly generated password, based on parameters that the user sets. In a world where passwords are required for many different activities in daily life, this project allows its users to provide themselves with secure passwords that are not going to be easily guessed.

The creation of this project allowed me to gain experience with different aspects and uses of javascript, including the use of randomised generators, for loops, if statements and functions. It allowed me to better grasp the fundamentals of coding logic and to apply this to creating a useful program.

## Usage

The individual is to click on the part that says 'Generate Password', where they will then be directed to answer a series of prompts that ask them to enter a password length, as well as whether or not they want lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters in their password. This then displays their randomly generated password.

If the user does not input an adequate value or does not select any type of characters to include in their password, they are asked to follow the prompts properly before a password is able to be provided to them.
